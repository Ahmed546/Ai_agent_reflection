       "Excellent implementation of the Fibonacci series! Your code is concise, efficient, and well-documented. Here are some minor suggestions for improvement:\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Consistent naming conventions:**\n",
       "In Python, it's conventional to use underscores to separate words in variable and function names (e.g., `fibonacci_sequence` instead of `fib_sequence`). While your naming is consistent within the code, following PEP 8 guidelines will make your code more readable and Pythonic.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Docstring improvement:**\n",
       "Your docstring is a good start! Consider adding a brief description of the function's return value, like this:\n",
       "```python\n",
       "def fibonacci(n):\n",
       "    \"\"\"\n",
       "    Returns the first n Fibonacci numbers as a list.\n",
       "\n",
       "    Args:\n",
       "        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.\n",
       "\n",
       "    Returns:\n",
       "        list: A list of the first n Fibonacci numbers.\n",
       "    \"\"\"\n",
       "    ...\n",
       "```\n",
       "This adds clarity and makes it easier for others (and yourself) to understand the function's behavior.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Error handling:**\n",
       "What if the user passes a non-integer or negative value for `n`? Consider adding some basic error handling to ensure your function behaves gracefully in such cases. For example:\n",
       "```python\n",
       "def fibonacci(n):\n",
       "    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:\n",
       "        raise ValueError(\"n must be a non-negative integer\")\n",
       "    ...\n",
       "```\n",
       "**4. Performance consideration:**\n",
       "While your implementation is efficient for small `n` values, it may become slower for larger values due to the repeated appending to the list. If you anticipate large `n` values, consider using a generator-based approach or a more optimized algorithm, like the matrix exponentiation method.\n",
       "\n",
       "**5. Functionality extension:**\n",
       "If you want to make your function more versatile, consider adding an optional argument to specify the starting point of the sequence (e.g., allowing the user to generate Fibonacci numbers starting from a specific index).\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, your implementation is solid, and these suggestions are just minor refinements. Keep up the good work!"

       "Your revised code looks great! You've made some excellent improvements. Here's a breakdown of the changes you made:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Changes analysis:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Renaming `fib_sequence` to `fibonacci_sequence`**: You've followed PEP 8 naming conventions by using underscore-separated words to make the variable name more readable. This is a great practice to follow in Python programming.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Improved docstring**: Your updated docstring provides a clear description of the function, including the return value and parameter documentation. This is extremely helpful for users who want to understand how to use the function.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Error handling**: You've added a check to ensure that `n` is a non-negative integer. This is essential because the Fibonacci sequence is only defined for non-negative integers. If `n` is not a non-negative integer, the function raises a `ValueError` with a helpful error message.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Additional suggestions:**\n",
       "\n",
       "To take your code to the next level, you could consider adding some additional features:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Memoization**: You could use memoization to store previously calculated Fibonacci numbers. This would significantly improve the performance of the function for large `n` values.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Generator implementation**: Instead of returning a list of Fibonacci numbers, you could return a generator that yields each number on the fly. This would be more memory-efficient for large `n` values.\n",

       "Here's an example of how you could implement memoization:\n",

       "    Returns the first n Fibonacci numbers as a list.\n",

       "Excellent implementation of the Fibonacci series! Your code is concise, efficient, and well-documented. Here are some minor suggestions for improvement:\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Consistent naming conventions:**\n",
       "In Python, it's conventional to use underscores to separate words in variable and function names (e.g., `fibonacci_sequence` instead of `fib_sequence`). While your naming is consistent within the code, following PEP 8 guidelines will make your code more readable and Pythonic.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Docstring improvement:**\n",
       "Your docstring is a good start! Consider adding a brief description of the function's return value, like this:\n",
       "```python\n",
       "def fibonacci(n):\n",
       "    \"\"\"\n",
       "    Returns the first n Fibonacci numbers as a list.\n",
       "\n",
       "    Args:\n",
       "        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.\n",
       "\n",
       "    Returns:\n",
       "        list: A list of the first n Fibonacci numbers.\n",
       "    \"\"\"\n",
       "    ...\n",
       "```\n",
       "This adds clarity and makes it easier for others (and yourself) to understand the function's behavior.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Error handling:**\n",
       "What if the user passes a non-integer or negative value for `n`? Consider adding some basic error handling to ensure your function behaves gracefully in such cases. For example:\n",
       "```python\n",
       "def fibonacci(n):\n",
       "    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:\n",
       "        raise ValueError(\"n must be a non-negative integer\")\n",
       "    ...\n",
       "```\n",
       "**4. Performance consideration:**\n",
       "While your implementation is efficient for small `n` values, it may become slower for larger values due to the repeated appending to the list. If you anticipate large `n` values, consider using a generator-based approach or a more optimized algorithm, like the matrix exponentiation method.\n",
       "\n",
       "**5. Functionality extension:**\n",
       "If you want to make your function more versatile, consider adding an optional argument to specify the starting point of the sequence (e.g., allowing the user to generate Fibonacci numbers starting from a specific index).\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, your implementation is solid, and these suggestions are just minor refinements. Keep up the good work!"
